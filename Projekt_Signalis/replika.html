          <h1>What are Replikas?</h1>
          <p class="article_paragraph">
            A Replika is a biomechanical, synthetic, and neural reproduction of
            a person. Created by copying the neural pattern of a human to form a
            new Replika Unit, their memories are suppressed and their skills
            kept intact to preserve the Replikas predictability and
            productivity. Humans chosen to serve as a neural pattern are
            permanently cryogenically preserved and erased from public memory to
            serve Eusan Nation as an <i>incorruptible ideal</i>.
          </p>
          <p class="article_paragraph">
            Manufactured like this Replikas will not be able to recall anything
            from its human life under normal circumstances. However, even the
            best-maintained Replika unit will eventually be exposed to stimuli
            that may cause human memories to resurface. While units degraded in
            such way pose no particular danger, like all units with Persona
            degradation, they will eventually lose many of their advantages over
            regular workers.
          </p>
          <p class="article_paragraph">
            Persona degradation is usually difficult to identify, so they are
            kept under watch by commanding units who monitor their behaviour. It
            is recommended to dispose of a unit as soon as it shows any signs of
            individualism.
          </p>
          <p class="article_paragraph">
            Replikas can be classified by their unit class which describes their
            frame, neural patterns and optimal roles. They also receive more
            casual designation names all of which are corresponding to a bird
            name in german.

              <h2>EULR</h2>
              <p>
                Unit class EULR (Einfache-Universelle-Leichte Replika), (Simple
                Universal Light Replika), designation name Eule are low-cost
                general purpose Replikas used for lighter jobs such as cooking,
                nursing, cleaning and simple office job.
              </p>
              <p>
                EULR units are the backbone of the Eusan Nation's workforce.
                These elegant multi-purpose worker units are highly social and
                get along well with each other and most other Replika models.
                While unfit for combat, their lightweight frame makes them a
                prime choice for distant facilities where supplies are limited.
              </p>
              <p>
                Eules tend to form large groups and like to sing and dance, as
                the original neural pattern for this unit was a ballet dancer.
                Persona degradation can be easily prevented in this unit by
                making sure they have access to music (through tape players or
                musical instruments). Always place at least one mirror in Eule
                dorms, as they have a strong urge to check their own appearance
                at regular intervals. Eules' Persona stabilizes by keeping a
                tidy appearance and through regular social interactions. Eules
                will often organize in groups of roughly ten units and give each
                other themed nicknames.
              </p>
              <p>
                Degraded Eules serve as standard oponent during the game. They
                usually carry knives and other daily used items which they most
                likely obtained from their initial roles. They also tend to
                gather in groups or accompany other degraded units.

              <h2>ARAR</h2>
              <p>
                Unit class ARAR (Allzweck-Reparatur-Arbeiter Replika),
                (All-Purpose Repair Worker Replika), designation name Ara are
                low-cost general purpose Replikas used in repair, maintenance,
                construction and production of industrial goods.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the earliest Replika designs, the simple but efficient
                Aras are actually the most-produced Replika type. They've
                replaced all human workers in especially dangerous working
                conditions. Aras often construct service tunnels accessible only
                to them, usually under floors and in walls. Unstable units may
                retreat into these tunnels. It is not recommended to attempt to
                retrieve them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even though they may seem like quiet simpletons, they are not to
                be underestimated. While they may not show it, they judge those
                who are rude or unkind harshly and will quietly share this
                judgment with their entire Cadre. Aras get along best with
                Eules, who tend to be patient and friendly, and have a talent
                for reading Aras' expressionless faces. Their Personalities can
                be stabilized by allowing them access to plants to take care of,
                ideally colorful flowers or trees.
              </p>
              <p>
                Corrupted Aras have inflated puffy arms and a corroded head, are
                hunched over, exposing the skin on their back which has degraded
                to the point of exposing flesh and their spinal structure
                underneath. They hide in the vents of the facility before
                emerging from underneath the floor to attack the player.

              <h2>LSTR</h2>
              <p>
                Unit class LSTR (Landvermessungs-Schiff-Techniker Replika),
                (Land Survey, Ship Technician Replika), designation name Elster
                are Kosmo-Pioneer Specialist designed to assist orbital missions
                and scout harsh terrain.
              </p>
              <p>
                LSTRs have a Titanium Skeleton Frame, which contains a Repair
                Logic Module. This Module can be used by LSTR units to easily
                repair themselves and crucial mission equipment. Elsters'
                technical knowledge and combat capabilities make these units
                true survivalists
              </p>
              <p>
                Stoic and reserved, they have a relatively stable neural
                pattern. It is best for human partners to leave it alone and
                interact with the Elster unit as little as possible. Elsters'
                neural pattern was a soldier of Vinetan origin, so their needs
                are basic. Avoid talking to the Elster unit about the war. To
                avoid resurfacing of human memories, do not show or give the
                Elster unit photographs, especially of soldiers during the war.
                Do not show the Elster unit movies, or let it listen to music.
                Do not try to befriend the Elster unit.
              </p>
              <p>
                The original neural pattern for this unit was lost with the
                destruction of the central Neural Archive on Vineta, new LSTR
                units have been produced based on a decommissioned unit from the
                Penrose Program.

              <h2>ADLR</h2>
              <p>
                Unit class ADLR (Administration, Datenverarbeitung,
                Logistik-Replika), (Administration, Data Processing, Logistics
                Replika), designation name Adler are command specialist Replika.
                They are employed as facility administrators across Eusan
                Nation, often serving as adjutant to FKLR units.
              </p>
              <p>
                An integral part of every facility is the Administrator unit. A
                single ADLR unit can manage and oversee all administrative tasks
                for an entire facility, freeing other Operation Command units to
                focus on the direct control of Protektor units.
              </p>
              <p>
                Adler units work best when left alone. They do not mix well with
                their own type. They will usually become very emotionally
                dependent on their Commander. Adlers are very susceptible to
                bioresonant suggestion, making them fairly easy to control.
                However, they become bored very easily and may need new Fetish
                objects at regular intervals for stabilization.
              </p>
              <p>
                Adler which players meet in a game serves as the antagonist for
                the story. We learn that his commanding FKLR unit fell ill due
                to an unknown sickness carried from the mines which led him to a
                lot of emotional stress and Persona destabilization. Said
                sickness quickly spread on other Replika units avoiding ADLR for
                an unknown reason.

                Unit class MNHR (Minenarbeit, Nukleartechnik,
                Hochsicherheits-Replika), (Mining, Nuclear Tech, High-Security
                Replika), designation name Mynah are industrial specialist
                Replika. They are deployed in hazardous work environments across
                Eusan Nation such as mines or nuclear power plants.
              </p>
              <p>
                When it comes to dangerous cargo, heavy machinery and hazardous
                environments, no other model rivals the MNHR units with their
                high-security power armor bodies. Even in lethal radiation,
                under crushing pressure and in zero G, they keep their calm
                demeanor and show exemplary teamwork. Despite their hulking
                bodies, underneath their face shields a standard Generation 3
                Replika face can be found, making maintenance and social
                interfacing as easy as with any other Replika Model. Please note
                that the MNHR neural pattern is not suited for combat use.
              </p>
              <p>
                Their neural pattern is extremely stable. Little has to be done
                to keep Mynahs happy. They get along well with most other models
                thanks to their sometimes submissive, sometimes motherly
                personality. Unlike other models, diary-keeping is not mandatory
                for Persona stabilization. Small stuffed animals may be given as
                fetish objects, though those resembling cats should be avoided
                as they might cause resurfacing Gestalt memories.

                aided by a cadre of KLBR unit adjutants, which can amplify her
                bioresonant signals. Despite their diminutive build, Kolibris
                are one of the most effective Protektor units as they are able
                to directly influence the minds of Replikas and humans.
              </p>
              <p>
                Great care should be given to Kolibris as their neural patterns
                are very unstable. Like most bioresonant individuals, Kolibris
                will often subconsciously create an emotional feedback loop,
                imitating and then broadcasting the emotions of those around
                them. That's why already unstable units can sometimes spiral
                into Persona degradation. The constant exchange of memories and
                emotions between units of a Cadre acts as a <i>safety net</i>
                that buffers extreme changes. However, once a majority of units
                in a Cadre degrade, they will drag the remaining units down with
                them. For Persona stabilization, Kolibris should have access to
                a well-stocked library.

              <h2>STAR</h2>
              <p>
                Unit class STAR (Sicherheitstechniker Aufseher Replika),
                (Security Technician Guard Replika), designation name Star are
                low-cost combat units. They serve as protektor security and
                technician guards
              </p>
              <p>
                The Standard model of the Protektor Security Technicians. Fitted
                with extended legs, STAR units gracefully tower over most
                humans. Despite their heavy armor, they can move swiftly with
                their long stride. Their cool and detached demeanor allows them
                to analyze situations with objectivity and deploy force as
                required. Trained in close combat and riot control techniques,
                they operate best in small squads led by an officer STAR unit
                equipped with a ballistic shield.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite their normally laid-back demeanor, STARs have a strong
                internal hierarchy, which is important to take into
                consideration when promoting units to officers. Not promoting a
                respected unit or promoting a unit low in status can lead to
                friction within dorms. STARs will occasionally develop in-group
                rules involving physical punishments. It is recommended to allow
                some Officers to own military weapons as Fetish objects to
                stabilize their Persona.
              </p>
              <p>
                STARs are one of the most irritating enemies during the game
                since they carry a ballistic shield with them. They are also
                often accompanied by weaker units.

              <h2>STCR</h2>
              <p>
                Unit class STCR (Sicherheitstechniker Controller Replika),
                (Security Technician Controller Replika), designation name
                Storch are combat lead replikas. Storches are deployed to
                oversee and coordinate STARs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Storch units initially have a short temper. Training them in
                patience early after deployment is key, as their neural patterns
                are less stable then other models. Failing to do so may yield an
                extremely volatile personality prone to cruelty and violence. A
                common strategy is pairing them closely with an older Star unit.
                Storch's Persona stabilizes by showering or bathing. Books on
                history or mythology work well as Fetish objects.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each Cadre of STARs is overseen by a Controller Unit STCR. One
                of the tallest Replika models thanks to their extended legs,
                Storks figuratively and literally keep a constant birds-eye view
                of any situation ready to direct and coordinate their assigned
                Security Technicians. Their tough, no-nonsense demeanor, though
                sometimes described as brutal and even cruel, makes them the
                perfect fit as unwavering sentinels of order.
              </p>
              <p>
                They serve as toughest regural enemies, usually accompanied by
                weaker units they pose a significant threat to the player. After
                degradation they were distorted almost beyond recognition, with
                their arms missing and their heads replaced with a strange
                beak-like growth.

            <h1>FKLR</h1>
            <p>
              Unit class FKLR (Führungskommando Leiteinheit Replika),
              (Operational Command Control Unit Replika), designation name Falke
              are High-Tech Bioresonance Command Replikas. These Replikas are
              used in every facility across the Eusan Nation as the commander of
              the Protektor security forces of these facilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Protektor Führungskommando's Commander, the head of each
              facility's Protektor force, is a powerful prototype bioresonant
              Falke unit. An authority that may never be questioned, a Falke
              unit serves not just as a commander to the Protektors, but as a
              nearly god-like being, a perception that is underlined by her tall
              build and resemblance to Eusan Nation's Leaders.
            </p>
            <p>
              Falkes are unique as their known issues page is not found within
              the game unlike every other Replika. This is due to the fact that
              such information is most likely only avaliable to Eusan Nation's
              leaders.
            </p>
            <p>
              Falkes are depicted on the Wunderwaffen propaganda pieces, which
              depict a Falke unit holding the Eusan Nation's flag while
              trampling on the symbol of the Empire. This is indicative of the
              important role that Falke units play as figures of authority and
              symbols of the revolution.
            </p>
            <p>
              Falke unit player meets in a game felt sick after she went to the
              mines under the facility where she found... something. Or that
              something found her. It is through Falke's notes player first
              reads about mysterious red gate found underground which leads
              to... something and about dreams of crashed ship and strange young
              woman. A woman with white hair.
