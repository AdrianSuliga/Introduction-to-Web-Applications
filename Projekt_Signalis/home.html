              Wake up. Remember what you promised. Your ship has crashed on an
              unknown planet. Systems are down, beyond repair. As you assess the
              wreckage, you discover your partner—your pilot—is missing. So is
              one of the spacesuits. There's only one path left to take.
            </p>
            <p class="article_paragtaph">
              You leave the ship—Penrose 512, a scout shuttle crafted to carry
              humanity's emissaries into the dark stretches of alien stars. It
              was a cheap but dependable vessel. Now, it's ruined. You step out
              into the unknown, leaving the wreck behind.
            </p>
            <p class="article_paragtaph">
              The only greeting is the blizzard, howling around you, an endless
              storm that conceals the landscape. You can barely see two meters
              ahead. There's no sign of her—Alina Seo, wasn't it? Yes, that was
              her name.
            </p>
            <p class="article_paragtaph">
              Questions emerge, drifting towards you. But one of them
              overshadows all the rest: Who are you? Can you even answer that?
            </p>
            <p class="article_paragtaph">
              You're not human. You are a Replika unit, codename LSTR-512—a
              Kosmo-Pioneer specialist android. Your mission was simple: to
              maintain Penrose during its journey and assist your Gestalt pilot.
              But that mission is meaningless now. You push through the
              blizzard, until you find... a hole, burrowed into the frozen
              ground. An unsettling sight, for it's not just a hole—it's lined
              with red, raw flesh.
            </p>
            <p class="article_paragtaph">
              You descend, moving deeper into the unknown. The tunnel leads you
              to... a room. Strangely welcoming, almost cozy. An old radio rests
              on the table beside a worn, ancient-looking book—The King in
              Yellow. You pick it up, and the radio crackles to life,
              broadcasting garbled numbers in a distorted voice. Your vision
              wavers, and then you hear it—her voice, familiar yet haunting,
              whispering:
            </p>
