            <h1>Wake Up</h1>
            <p class="article_paragraph">
              Wake up. Remember what you promised. Your ship has crashed on an
              unknown planet. Systems are down, beyond repair. As you assess the
              wreckage, you discover your partner — your pilot — is missing. So
              is one of the spacesuits. There's only one path left to take.
            </p>
            <p class="article_paragraph">
              You leave the ship — Penrose 512, a scout shuttle crafted to carry
              humanity's emissaries into the dark stretches of alien stars. It
              was a cheap but dependable vessel. Now, it's ruined. You step out
              into the unknown, leaving the wreck behind.
            </p>
            <p class="article_paragraph">
              The only greeting is the blizzard, howling around you, an endless
              storm that conceals the landscape. You can barely see two meters
              ahead. There's no sign of her — Alina Seo, wasn't it? Yes, that
              was her name.
            </p>
            <p class="article_paragraph">
              Questions emerge, drifting towards you. But one of them
              overshadows all the rest: Who are you? Can you even answer that?
            </p>
            <p class="article_paragraph">
              You're not human. You are a Replika unit, codename LSTR-512—a
              Kosmo-Pioneer specialist android. Your mission was simple: to
              maintain Penrose during its journey and assist your Gestalt pilot.
              But that mission is meaningless now. You push through the
              blizzard, until you find... a hole, burrowed into the frozen
              ground. An unsettling sight, for it's not just a hole—it's lined
              with red, raw flesh.
            </p>
            <p class="article_paragraph">
              You descend, moving deeper into the unknown. The tunnel leads you
              to... a room. Strangely welcoming, almost cozy. An old radio rests
              on the table beside a worn, ancient-looking book — The King in
              Yellow. You pick it up, and the radio crackles to life,
              broadcasting garbled numbers in a distorted voice. Your vision
              wavers, and then you hear it — her voice, familiar yet haunting,
              whispering:
            </p>

            <h1>Actual introduction</h1>
            <p class="article_paragraph">
              <i>SIGNALIS</i> is a survival horror video game developed by
              Rose-Engine and published by Humble Games and Playism, released on
              October 27, 2022. The game features an unusual aesthetic that
              merges retrofuturism with anime, immersing players in a dystopian
              world ruled by a totalitarian regime and plagued by endless war.
            </p>
            <p class="article_paragraph">
              The gameplay draws clear inspiration from <i>Resident Evil</i>,
              combining exploration and resource management with old-fashioned
              puzzles and top-down shooting. Set in a distant, unspecified solar
              system (with fan theories suggesting it may be a far-future
              version of our own, unrecognizable due to passage of time).
            </p>
            <p class="article_paragraph">
              The story follows Elster, a Replika unit, whose ship has
              crash-landed on an unknown planet. Elster awakens to find her
              partner missing, and after a mysterious prologue described above,
              she regains consciousness in a bathroom within S-23 Sierpinski — a
              production and mining facility on the planet... Leng, a part of
              her home solar system. She states her goal is to find Alina Seo.
            </p>
            <p class="article_paragraph">
              Facility seems to be abondoned at first but when Elster ventures
              deeper she finds dead replika units, both regular workers and
              combat types. It doesn't take too much time for one of the corpses
              to come to live screaming at her and then you realize that
              <i>Resident Evil</i> inspirations went deeper than puzzles and
              inventory management.
            </p>
            <p class="article_paragraph">
              Further exploration reveals that most of the Gestalt (in-game term
              for humans) staff are dead, and the Replika workforce has
              degenerated into mindless, hostile beings. Gathering supplies and
              clues, Elster moves through the eerie facility, determined to
              uncover Alina's fate.
            </p>
            <p class="article_paragraph">
              By the end of the first part Elster finds Replika which seems to
              function normally - ADLR class, designation Adler - facility's
              administrator. Things finally appear to take a turn for the better
              when Elster shows Alina's photo to Adler. His expression suddenly
              becomes gloomy when he looks back at her and pushes her down the
              elevator shaft saying.

              Well... is seems there is a lot more to learn.

            <h1>Expectations</h1>
            <p class="article_paragraph">
              <i>SIGNALIS</i> is a game that requires a specific mindset to
              fully appreciate. One of the biggest mistakes you can make is
              assuming the story will be straightforward and fully
              comprehensible after a single playthrough. I made this assumption
              myself—seeing the game's taking inspiration from
              <i>Resident Evil</i>, I expected a similarly direct narrative.
            </p>
            <p class="article_paragraph">
              Unfortunately, <i>SIGNALIS</i> doesn't offer this kind of
              experience. The plot here is convoluted, often contradictory
              and... well, let's just say that the events you experience aren't
              exactly real. Just like in a dream. You might have realized that
              after reading about beginning of the game. It throws a lot of
              mysteries and information at you and it doesn't give clear answer
              to practically any of it.
            </p>
            <p class="article_paragraph">
              Did you notice, in the previous section of this article, that the
              photo of Elster's copilot and Alina Seo, who main character says
              is her copilot, are... different? They don't look alike. The game
              doesn't tell you why Elster seems to ignore that fact and randomly
              starts looking for a different woman until the end of the game!
              And by <i>tell you</i> I mean that it gives you enough information
              so that you can piece some answers together on your own.
            </p>
            <p class="article_paragraph">
              This sort of pattern repeats practically in every plot point in
              the game. When I first finished it I had no idea what actually
              happened, what was supposed to be real and what was just a dream?.
              Was it all a dream? Moreover, I was very frustrated since I
              considered games that leave you in this state at the end to be...
              well... bad.
            </p>
            <p class="article_paragraph">
              But I didn't stop there. I began to dig deeper—replaying parts of
              the game, reading others' theories, and reflecting on my
              experiences. Gradually, a bigger picture started to emerge. As it
              turns our, <i>SIGNALIS</i> actually does provide answers to nearly
              every essential question! They're just hidden and require more
              than a single playthrough to uncover and as someone who discovered
              them I can assure you - it is worth it.
            </p>

              free) I invite you to explore this websites and find out more
